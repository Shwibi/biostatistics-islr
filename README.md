# Self-Learning Statistics using ISLR

## What is ISLR

ISLR is _Introduction to Statistical Learning_ (with R) meant as an introduction to statistical methods while using the programming language `R` to demonstrate problems and solutions.
Visit the official website [here](https://www.statlearning.com/).

## What is this Repository

This Repo is my personal progress in learning Statistics using ISLR. It includes the files I make following ISLR Labs, but they are not one-to-one copy of what is showcased in ISLR.
This is mostly because the latest/modern libraries and tools in R are different from those used in ISLR Labs, and I have tried to migrate all exercises to the modern way. Sometimes, this might result in things becoming more complicated, or less complicated, but overall it makes it so that all of the exercises are consistent with the current methods used in `R`.

## Progress Logs

### ISLR Chapter 02: Statistical Learning

This includes a very basic manipulation of data in `R`. Some of the functions have been implemented, but the way they work is not necessarily clear to me. Instead of being distracted by something I cannot understand right now, I will have to come back and see if it makes sense after being exposed to more of the language in the future, similar to how learning any new topic goes.

### ISLR Chapter 03: Linear Regression

ISLR does not include matrices, and they aren't needed for Simple Linear Regression with 2 predictors. However, knowing the geometry early creates a path that makes it easy to understand more advanced statistical models, and thus, before moving on to Multiple Linear Regression, I have completed 3Blue1Brown's Essence of Linear Algebra series on YouTube ([here](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab))

Another great source for Linear Algebra are the Lectures on Linear algebra by Gilbert Strang in MIT OCW 18.06 which can be found [here](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/syllabus/).

# Skills Used

# Background

I am a third-year MBBS student transitioning into Computational Biology and Biostatistics. This repository includes my progress in Biostatistics using ISLR, not Linear Algebra or animations and visuals.
I will add those projects as well, in due time.
I have always been interested in finding the "Why?" behind things, even when it seems there is no choice but to memorise something, from the surface. But most of the times, the "Why?" is just hidden behind a topic or a wall that looks too difficult to scale, or too rigorous and unimportant. There is always a reason, always a train of thought that can explain each and everything that exists in this world.
This thought process was first introduced to me by 3Blue1Brown and Feynman's Lectures on Physics, and learning to "code" prior to that. After understanding how "coding" is just a way of speaking to the computer, essentially a language that is only useful if the content is useful, I started diving deeper into other aspects which I had earlier cast off as insignificant or useless. Years later, here I am, trying to understand how Biological Systems and Non-Biological systems work using Math and Physics.
